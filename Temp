Statistics:
1.	Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics is the right solution for presenting an overall picture about a set of data. These
methodologies represent summaries, which give a fair picture about a given population. The business
insights earned from the analysis of data will be in the form of tables and charts. Descriptive statistics output
might help draw useful inferences, but this output in itself is not an inference.
Here is a sales example. Descriptive statistics, applied on one year’s worth of sales data, might include
average sales in the last 12 months, maximum and minimum sales of the past 12 months, and so on. The
business expert can infer on the performance on his or her business, based on this analysis.
The following are the important measures or outcomes of descriptive statistics:

	• Measures of central tendency: Mean, median, mode, and midrange
	• Measures of variation: Range, variance, standard deviation, z-scores

2.	Inferential	
Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics provide a concise summary of data. You can summarize data numerically or graphically. For example, the manager of a fast food restaurant tracks the wait times for customers during the lunch hour for a week. Then, the manager summarizes the data.
1.	measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode),
2.	measures of variability(standard deviation or variance),
3.	spread. 
4.	minimum and maximum variables, Range quartiles 
5.	kurtosis and skewness
Inferential statistics allows you to make predictions (“inferences”) from that data. With inferential statistics, you take data from samples and make generalizations about a population. 
There are two main areas of inferential statistics:
1.	Estimating parameters. This means taking a statistic from your sample data (for example the sample mean) and using it to say something about a population parameter (i.e. the population mean).
2.	Hypothesis tests. This is where you can use sample data to answer research questions. For example, you might be interested in knowing if a new cancer drug is effective. Or if breakfast helps children perform better in schools.
indexes for inferential statistics articles are:
•	Binomial Theorem

•	Normal Distributions
•	T-Distributions

•	Confidence Intervals
•	Regression Analysis / Linear Regression
•	Comparison of Means.
